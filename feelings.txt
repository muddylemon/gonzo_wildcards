wallowing in despair
spinning with joy
crying in terror
shaking with rage
shrinking with shame
dancing with delight
screaming with frustration
sighing with relief
singing with happiness
sobbing in grief
squealing with excitement
stomping in anger
trembling with fear
wailing in sorrow
whimpering in pain
whining in frustration
ecstatic with love
weeping in despair
whispering in awe
yelling in anger
crouching in fear
cowering in fear
flying with joy
prancing with joy
pacing in frustration
waving arms in frustration
waving arms in anger
squatting in stubborness
turning away in shame
turning in circles in confusion
jumping with joy
moaning in pain
moaning in pleasure
moaning in frustration
screaming in terror
crying in agony
crying in frustration
crying in anger
crying in fear
crying in joy
frowning in anger
frowning in frustration
frowning in confusion
frowning in sadness
